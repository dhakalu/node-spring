This is a javascript library that provides similar functionality of SpringBoot. Read more about SpringBoot [here](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#learn).

This library can be used to create Restful APIs easily with decorative coding.

Features provided:

- Dependency Injection (e.g. `@InjectArgument('beanName') someBean: TypeOfBean;`)
